Lets you carry more wands by stowing them away in a bag, from which you can take them out anytime.

Open the bag by clicking the icon to the left of the wand selection.
Then click on a wand to stow it away, click on a wand in the storage to take it back out again.
It might bug out sometimes so make sure you have the right wand selected (maybe reselect it) before firing.
